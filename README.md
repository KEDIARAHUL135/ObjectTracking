# ObjectTracking

This project aims to track moving object in a video and create a bounding rectangle on them.


### Assumptions 

* The camera should be still and objects should be moving


### Bugs

* There is a lot of noise in the video when object is tracked but the noise is within the boundaries of the moving object only.
